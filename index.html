                   <p>What is the Cultural Diary?</p>
<p>The Cultural Diary is a paper which gives us the opportunity to develop our critical mind toward a specific subject. It is not about creating a scientific review but more on developing our instinct and writing about our personal interpretation of a current managerial or economic situation. </p>

<p>My Subject: Is VR headsets a trend or a revolution in the gaming industry?</p>
<p>The virtual Reality is the new buzzword in the video game industry. VR headsets are seen as new tools that offer new opportunities for players and game designers through new hardware. But compared to software innovation, the hardware innovation often runs to nothing. Kinect, for example, was a good idea, promoted by Microsoft with a lot of marketing help, however, it didn’t work. Moreover, as a player, you have a lot of difficulties to use new controllers: It’s why PC players and console players encounter a lot of difficulties to play with the controller of the other platform. It takes you a dozen of games to feel efficient with a specific hardware. A dozen of games is often the number of games that a player owns on one generation of console. Indeed a console lasts in general 8 years, and you generally buy 1 or 2 games per year. To find success a new hardware needs to allow new gameplay. In order to become a real advantage compared to the previous hardware. So for a console provider, it’s a real risk to develop a new hardware device: due to multiple parameters, you can lose all your investment for the next 8 years. To this extent, we can ask ourselves if VR headsets are hardware devices that give new gameplay opportunities? As gamers, do we want to play with this new rules? Is it like Kinect just a trendy tool that marketers use to take your money? Or is it a real revolution that will disrupt this industry?</p>

<p>I choose to display my cultural diary on a Web page. Indeed I want to use the opportunity of the cultural diary to learn how to make a website. I will learn HTML5 and CSS3, to code the Web-page. </p>

<p>I divided my work into 6 articles:</p>

<p>1. Introduction   2. General figures   3. A Competitive framework   4. The quality of games, a qualitative survey of gamers review.    5. Comparison with other “revolutionary” devices, and limits of the devices    6. Conclusion</p>
