To meet the success VR needs to overcome its limits !

                    <h1><img src="images/ico_epingle.png" alt="Catégorie voyage" class="ico_categorie" />VR games' quality</h1>
                   <p>In this part, we will do a short review of the personal experience of players of the most profitable game in VR: Fallout 4 VR. To reach our goal we will use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fallout+4+VR">this Youtube playlist</a>. I have to prevent you in most of this videos, players used a lot of bad words. But we need to analyze them, indeed some of these videos allow us to have an in-depth description of what our players’ feeling about this game. That being said, let's comment the video. </p>

<p>Two main topics emerge The quality of the game and the issue encountered in the playthrough session of the game. We will first talk about positive aspects and then about issues.</p>

<p>In these videos, we see that players get a huge pleasure to play the game. It’s really immersive, you have truly the impression to have the constructed universe in front of you. This gives to details another importance, everything is more entertaining. All your action are magnified by the fact that you are no longer in your salon but really in the game. And after a little bit of time, you start to get used to the controllers. The controllers then become an extension of yourself and allow you to truly enjoy the game. The motion sickness depicts in many VR games are here little. It seems that the game developers change their level design and build a bigger world where the environment surrounds you less than the original game so it provokes you less motion sickness. Also, the use of the music is spectacular, you really have the impression to be in a movie.</p>

<p>But there are still many issues. Developers are not used to creating games on this device and major problem emerge due to it: For example, they didn’t test the game on multiple PC configurations which lead to major graphics problems. The game has a lot of bugs and your progression is stopped by too much of them. So the gaming experience starts to be really painful. Another major issue is that the headset is to heavy for the game. The game was originally made for an average game session of 2 hours. But the headset doesn’t allow such long sessions, after 1 hour your neck starts to be painful. So there is kind of a opposition between how the game should be played and how the device allows you to play.</p>

<p>All in all the Fallout 4 VR experience perceived by the player looks like being one of the best game experience they ever had. This is also due to the work that the company made to patch the game as much as possible. So one of the issues of the VR market is just its immaturity.</p>

<p>When I tried it, I was really impressed with how you feel yourself into the game, it’s really awesome. You feel yourself elsewhere. But the game I played wasn’t so great… I was really short and empty. And I had the feeling that I wasn’t really a player and much more a spectator.
