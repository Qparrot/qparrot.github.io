                   <p>In the tech world, many projects were meant to be a huge success. For example <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.fr/us/why-microsoft-xbox-kinect-didnt-take-off-2015-9"> Kinect</a> and
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/5-reasons-google-glass-miserable-failure-01462398"> Google</a> Glass. These two devices were helped by great marketing campaigns, but they completely failed to become widely spread. The biggest issues, that these two articles describe, are:</p>
<p>- A lack of Killer Apps. A killer app is a software so great that it makes sell the product needed to use this software.</p>
<p>- The device doesn’t fit the costumer's requirements. The Google glass needed a lot of autonomy, a lot of data and better applications, all of this available at a cheaper price. Because of this lack of quality the product was a failure. For Kinect it’s kind of the same: the product wasn’t really accurate in tracking the motion of people (which was its main purpose), the game library was small and not qualitative. So players quit the project due to a lack of interest.</p>

<p>Based on this comparison we can highlight the biggest threat to make VR not only a trend but a revolution. First, it needs Killer Apps that defend correctly VR devices. It is clear that today the software around VR is bad, because of less knowledge of the device and a lack of investment. VR development provokes unpolished work, because of a lack of time and a technology not really well managed. Developers need to dive into this environment and provide players with great and new experiences. But it is really hard to get it. It needs a lot of investment and the return is really hard to get. In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamekult.com/actualite/ccp-games-fait-une-croix-sur-la-realite-virtuelle-et-se-restructure-3050799565.html">this article</a>, we discover that CCP games: one of the first studios which develops VR games just quit the race due to too much cost. This means that the VR industry is still immature, and the product life circle is still in its early phase. In all the following articles from Gamasutra, we read <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AlistairDoulin/20160614/274884/Virtual_Reality_Development_Tips.php">tips for developing VR games</a> which are pretty basic but very necessary due to <a target="_blank" href="
https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/306332/The_world_is_the_genre_How_devs_can_make_more_meaningful_VRMR_games.php">the new paradigm</a> that represents VR. This also reinforces the fact that VR developer is not really aware of all the things you have to think of when you develop a VR game.  </p>


<p>Current VR games are more movies with a little number of interactions than real games. Because of this, players of VR games become spectators. This feeling is really something that the VR constructor should be aware of and should fight against. Players are the one who allows VR to grow, they want to continue to be players to influence the universe in which they are. If players are too much in this situation of being a spectator with VR experience for sure they will stop using VR.</p>
<p>VR devices need to be efficient and give what players imagine from a VR experience. This means to be immersed in the game. So the tracking needs to be perfect, displacements in the game must be easy to do and avoid motion sickness. The weight of the device needs to be reduced as much as possible.
To avoid motion sickness we may also need a device like the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVs7iegtDIk">infinadeck</a> a VR treadmill. This kind of device will stop motion sickness. It will enhance the VR experience and bring it to a next step.</p>

 

<p>But there are also social issues, many people fight against VR because they think players will be too engaged in the game. At such a point that players will be inclined to prefer virtual world instead of reality and it can lead to major health and social issues. Socialization can be even harder: if you associate IA and VR every relationship will seem easier and people will prefer to exchange with IA than with real human being because it will be harder.
