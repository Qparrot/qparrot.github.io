In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/615968/global-virtual-and-augmented-reality-economic-impact/">this article</a>, we see that the growth of the VR market between 2017 and 2018 will be at least of 50%. To reach a dominant situation, companies are ready to do some dumping in order to be the leader in the market. We see the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive reduce their price. Since August 2017 the HTC Vive come from a price of 900 € to a price of 600€. And the Oculus Rift reduces from 700€ to 400€. All this characteristic confirm one thing: we are in front of a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cultura.com/strategie-ocean-bleu-comment-creer-de-nouveaux-espaces-strategiques-9782744066306.html">Blue Ocean</a>, that starts to become a Red Ocean.</p>

<p>What is a Blue Ocean?</p>

<p>It’s a new market which is created by a company. It is and not a market where companies respond to the need of the customers and fight to have the biggest share. In a Blue Ocean, market companies can grow easily because everything has to be done. The competitors have to write the story of the market. The action of blue ocean strategy is mainly based on value innovation. You need to create uncontested market space by reconstructing market boundaries, you focus on the big picture, and try to reach new market spaces beyond existing demand and supply. </p>

<p>What is a red Ocean?</p>

<p>It is a market where the strategies are competition-based. This means that the main strategy is building advantages over competitors, the more often it is made by benchmarking what is done by others and trying to copy their best practices and then by trying to apply the best practices in a better way than competitors.</p>


<p>Here we can see that a blue ocean was created by the development of the Oculus Rift. It brings forward the VR experience. And the company starts to sell a lot of headsets. But time after time the situation changes, HTC Vive came and became a big competitor. Furthermore, even if the PlayStation VR is the last to enter this market it became the first one in term of sales. So Oculus Rift didn’t succeed to apply the Blue Ocean strategy. If you apply right the Blue Ocean strategy you develop skills and knowledge advantage and you shouldn’t be overcome by competitors. But with the purchased by Facebook and a lack of real initiative in term of R&D. Oculus Rift starts to be overwhelmed and the VR market starts to be a red ocean. A price race develops, and competitors start to copy each other: for instance, Oculus Rift developed the motion sensors after HTC Vive presented it. </p>



<p>A very interesting fact about the current strategy developed by VR devices providers is that Sony is now the leader. It seems not to really pleased The CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc, who declared in September 2017: “I’m not entirely comfortable being the market leader in VR by such a margin that seems to be happening right now,”. So this means that the leader of the VR industry doesn’t really know which strategy they have to follow to improve the situation of the VR industry. Furthermore, The Playstation VR is really only for gaming purposes, compare to  HTC Vive or Oculus Rift, which can be also used for serious games, industries, health, education, etc. So the leader of VR is only in the entertainment market, this means that for customers the perfect use of VR is for video games. But even knowing this statement, constructors are a bit stuck and don’t know how to develop the VR. This situation is really sad: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/615968/global-virtual-and-augmented-reality-economic-impact/">analysts forecast</a> a growth of 50% of the VR market for 2018. This means that everything is to be done. With a good strategy, constructors could be the winners of this economic game. </p>
