                   <p>Through all this reflexion, My opinion about VR sharpens. Its place in the big picture that represents the game industry is big. Even if VR is really new and in many ways demonstrate a lot of immaturities, VR is for me the “next big thing” in this industry. It is as important as the arrival of the 3D in the game industry. It changes the gameplay, develops new best practices. It is not only a trend but a real revolution and the purchase of Oculus VR by Facebook proved it. Compare to failure like Google Glass and Kinect, the technical hardware aspect fulfills the requirement of what is VR in the collective psyche.</p> 

<p>Through all this cultural diary I develop my critical mind and try to contextualize the VR environment. I present the most important figures and develop the current issues, limits encounter by this new type of device.</p>
