                    <h1><img src="images/ico_epingle.png" alt="Catégorie voyage" class="ico_categorie" />General figures</h1>
                   <p>Here are presented some figures to better understand the stakes of this new technology.

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2014/06/16/la-realite-virtuelle-une-revolution-pour-les-jeux-video_4438417_4408996.html"> This article</a> explains us the history of the virtual reality development in the game industry. All start with the Virtual Boy a device developed by Nintendo in 1995, but it was quickly abandoned.  Indeed the device failed due to a lack of quality and quantity of the games available on the device. </p>

<p>In 2012, Palmer Luckey develops in his spare time the Oculus Rift. In 2013 it was presented in the Consumer Electronic Show and in 2014 Facebook bought the company, Oculus VR, for 2 billion dollars.</p>
<p>The story of Oculus VR shows us VR is now a big deal, and Facebook trust in it. For them, it will be the next big things of the electronic industries. But the entry of Facebook in this industry can mean many things and doesn’t really say anything about the future of the gaming industry. Indeed Facebook wants to be one of the masters of information as we saw it with the recent scandal of Cambridge Analytica. : maybe Facebook want to use the Oculus Rift to map the living place of each user, their body shape, their health and all this kind of data. So the goal of Facebook is not really to implement VR in the game industry, but simply to develop the use of the VR headset to gather data.</p>

<p>After having introduced Facebook and Oculus Rift lets talk about the other headsets’ constructors : </p>



<p>In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/a/best-vr-headset-oculus-rift-samsung-gear-htc-vive-virtual-reality">this article</a>, “The Verge” do a buyer’s guide for VR headset. </p>
  
<p>We have Google, with the “Google Cardboard”. It is really to have the first try with VR because it is cheap but not very convenient. </p>

<p>Then there are the mid-range price VR Headsets. Like the LG 360 VR, the Samsung Gear VR, Homido. In my opinion, these headsets are just followers. They are not doing the trend and for sure they will not revolutionize the game industry. They will not change the game industry because of their software and hardware limitations. The OS of these devices is Android and the hardware can only be a phone, which will be forever less powerful than a PC. Another big issue with this devices is that, because the phone is used for displaying the image, you cannot use the phone as a gamepad so it doesn’t allow you to have any interaction. Therefore it’s impossible to have tremendous experience. But it is good to have this kind of device because they are affordable and democratize the concept of VR. </p>

<p>Finally, you have the high-end headset: The Playstation VR of Sony, the Oculus Rift from Facebook and the HTC Vive. These three devices are used in combination with a PC or a powerful console. It means that the processing power needed for VR can be delivered. It’s on this three devices that developers will be able to generate an impressive solution.</p>

<p>So I think we should only analyze the 3 last headsets. On <a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/more-than-a-fad-vr-headset-sales-are-slowly-creeping-higher">arstechnica</a>, we can see the following sales figures:</p>

<p>- PlayStation VR: 490,000 sales.</p>
<p>- Oculus Rift: 210,000 sales.</p>
<p>- HTC Vive: 140,000 sales.</p>

<p>This <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/valve-reveals-steams-top-selling-vr-games-in-2017/"> website</a>  delivers us the Games’ sales figures on Steam. Steam is the dominant PC online games’ retailer.</p>

<p>We saw in these charts that more game could be sold. Indeed Steam delivers games for Oculus and HTC Vive. It means in total around 350,000 customers. Still, the user’s record for a game is up to 170,000 players. And the smallest amount of users for a VR game is 24,000 for QuiVR. So there is a big marge for an increase of selling.</p> 

<p>We also have the gross revenues. In total all VR games represent 47 million dollars. 
Let’s do an optimistic estimation: Oculus Rift and HTC Vive represent 42 % of the market of high-end VR headset. We have the total number of revenues of VR games on steam. Most of the analysts say that steam now represent 50% of the sales of PC games.  Lets multiple by two the number of revenue of steam sales to have the approximation of the PC sales:  94 million dollars, so the gross revenues of games’ sales with the PlayStation VR represent: 58 * 94 / 42 = 129. The result of We estimate the totals revenues of VR games at 223 million dollars. This is nothing! 
The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fredzone.org/far-cry-5-est-apres-the-division-le-plus-gros-lancement-dubisoft-354">last AAA games release by Ubisoft made 310 million dollars</a>. In one classic game, we fit 1,5 time the revenues of all the games sold on VR supports…</p>

<p>This means the growth can be really important! Nothing is done now.</p>
